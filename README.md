This project is a simple and interactive Quiz Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to allow users to answer multiple-choice questions, get instant feedback, and track their scores dynamically. The quiz loads one question at a time from a predefined set of questions stored in JavaScript, and displays four answer options for each. When a user selects an option, the app immediately shows whether the answer was correct or not and updates the score accordingly. A “Next” button lets users move through the quiz, and after all questions are answered, the final score is displayed. The app uses basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, along with simple styling in CSS to create a clean and user-friendly interface. This task helped me practice core web development concepts and build a functional, responsive mini-project without any frameworks.
